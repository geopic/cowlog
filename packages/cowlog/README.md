Cowlog is **not for production code**, as it might cause performance issues. However, the tool provides **detailed information** about **where from you called** it from, so **you can locate and remove after debugging**. It gives you the **stack trace**. All the **log** messages **per process** to a separate file and **many more** things.

# Cowlog

Cowlog is the product of the vidaxl.com engineering efforts. Helps you to debug
your backend javascript code with less cognitive effort. It is a library that
helps you identify your debug message quickly on the **console output**.
Having
**[it's](https://github.com/vidaxl-com/cowlog/blob/master/packages/cowlog/documentation/logging_functionality.md)**
own
[domain-specific language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia")
regarding the logging procedures, it's behaviour can be altered
through the use
**[of them](https://github.com/vidaxl-com/cowlog/blob/master/packages/cowlog/documentation/logging_functionality.md).**
The project supports at the moment only the **NodeJs environment**.

We want cowlog to be usable in any circumstances without problems therefore we
have close **100% code coverage**, but at least 90%.

## Motivation

- Server-side applications tend to pollute the console still sometimes you want
to use console.log, and not solely use the amazing debug mode
[--inspect](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector/)
of the NodeJs.

- CowLog can help you refactor your code faster. 
Our aim is that the code would run on every node.js environment >= 6.4.0.

## Installation
```bash
npm install cowlog --save-dev
```

## Usage
For [more documentation click here](https://github.com/vidaxl-com/cowlog/blob/master/packages/cowlog/documentation/logging_functionality.md).
That document will leverage the power of the logging capabilities of this
library.

### Chances are high, "that's the way you like it..."
You will see all information with cowlog, no need to have
specially trained eye for development log messages, or particular identifiable
strings, before and after you want to look at.

- **session log**: Every you call cowlog, the results appear in a
separate file.

- **called from**: It is the exact place where you placed cowlog, so you can
remove it with ease, after you have inspected the variables in the
runtime.

The "stack trace" will help you, it sticks with cowlog.

### Basic logging (read further there are much more coolness)

If you don't have a global variable registered to l (cowlog.log) than cowlog will register them, so you can reach it from anywhere.
I know it is against all good practice, but don't forget to remove it after you
finished your development session.

### Cowlog has its own DSL

#### `l('your stuffs')('die')()`
Joe is dead here.

#### `l('your stuffs')('once')()`
Just once please! [lodash#once](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#once)

#### `l('your stuffs')('throttle', 2000)()`
Just like in the [lodash#throttle](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#throttle) documentation

#### `l('your stuffs')('debounce', 2000)()`
Just like in the [lodashe#debounce](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#debounce) documentation

#### `l('your stuffs')('lasts')()`
Collects these logs and displays if the application exits.

#### `l('your stuffs')('last')()`
Pretty much like the previous, it makes sure only this last call will be shown at the end.

#### `l('your stuffs')('mute')()`
Mutes the output. This can be convinient in some cases.

### DSL chaining
For instance typing 

`l('your stuffs')('throttle', 2000)('once')()` 

is legit.
Once it prints the output other than this it throttles it as well.

### Remarks
In the future, we will
add a production feature to the software, but that needs
some pressure from the community, and meanwhile, we have
more meaningful things to implement.
